Write a program that by receiving a positive integer, creates a next square matrix with the numbers one and zero
to display
Then, imagining that the numbers are a wall, check whether there is a path from the first row (top) to the bottom row of the matrix.

Is there or not?
For example, suppose the user has entered the number 5.
The program displays the following sample square and 5-dimensional matrix.
In the second part, your program should display the result yes because there is a path from the first line to the last line.
